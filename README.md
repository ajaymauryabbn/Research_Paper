About- Low light imaging is a challenge of cameras because of low photon counts and low signal to noise ratio. In case of low lighting taking an image becomes more
challenging and complex.Generally short exposure images suffers from noise, while long exposure images may induce blur due to camera shake or Object motion and is often impractical. In this paper we have proposed a learning based pipeline which uses Artificial intelligence to train his neurons to improve the learning,which can see in extremely low lighting. In this paper we are introducing a dataset of raw short-exposure low light imagesto correspond with images of long exposure time
